# Start a data science project here

This repository defines a container (that is, a lightweight virtual machine) with Python, R, Julia, and Jupyter pre-installed.

## How do I start?

Click the button below!  You'll get a web-based version of Visual Studio Code and start doing data science immediately.
(Well, okay, it takes a little while to build the container the first time.)

## How do I add files?

You can upload any file (data, scripts, notebooks, etc.) into the Codespace by just dragging it in from your PC.

Drop it into the files list on the left side of the editor.

## How do write code?

You can create and run both scripts and Jupyter notebooks.

Use the hamburger menu (three lines) on the top left to create a new file, which can be plain text, a Python script, or a Jupyter notebook.

In a Python script (`.py` file) you can run the script with the Run button (▶️) on the top right.

In a Jupyter notebook, you first select a kernel from the top right (Python, R, or Julia) and then use the buttons at the top of the notebook to run one or more cells.

## How do I save my work?

Your work is automatically saved in the container being run in the cloud, even if you close the browser tab.  You can come back later and pick up where you left off.

It will eventually be deleted, though, so to save it permanently, [publish it to your own GitHub account as a new repository.](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/creating-a-codespace-from-a-template#publishing-from-vs-code)
