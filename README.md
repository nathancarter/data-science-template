This repository defines a container (that is, a lightweight virtual machine) with Python, R, Julia, and Jupyter pre-installed.

You can click the button below to launch a web-based version of Visual Studio Code and start doing data science immediately.
(Well, okay, it takes a little while to build the container the first time.)
